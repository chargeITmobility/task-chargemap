## User Story
As a User I want to see all charging stations filtered by type in a specific radius on a map, to see how many of them in my area have a connector type that fits  my electric car requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Radius is editable
- Initial radius is 10km
- Charging stations can be filtered by the connector types Type 2, CHAdeMO and CCS
- Initially all three connector type filters are activated
- Other connector types must be ignored
- A map centered with the user's current location is shown
- Charging stations are shown as markers
  - Available charging stations will be shown green
  - Not available charging Stations will be shown red

  - Street
  - Zip

  - Longitude
  - Operator
  - Distance (calculated from user's current location to the geo point of the charging station)
  - Status as Available or Occupied

    - Max Power
    - Pricing Info
- The map updates every
  - Radius change
